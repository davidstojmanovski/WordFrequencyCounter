# WordFrequencyCounter
This web application ,designed in ASP.NET MVC, and its main purpose is to receive the users .txt file via file-chooser and return the number of occurrences
of every word in the file. The front-end is using data-table to present the data (with sorting, filtering,etc...) , with Javascript sourced data. 
The back-end word counting and other calculations are done optimally, using dictionary.
