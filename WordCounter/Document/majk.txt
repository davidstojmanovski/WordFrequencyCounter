What is new in version 6.2 (2018-03-01)

Added support for Windows Store. If you are on Windows 10 (version 1607 or newer), you can now install, uninstall, and automatically get updates for PureText from the Store.
Added some warning dialogs if PureText is already running. This can help resolve some confusion if you have multiple versions of PureText on your computer.
Localization file can reside in the app directory, the user's local app data directory, or the system's app data directory. This is needed to support Window Store installs that don't allow access to the app directory.
What was new in version 6.1 (2017-10-21)

Fixed an issue that caused PureText to periodically hang for several seconds.
What was new in version 6.0 (2017-10-17)

Fixed pasting issue with Windows 10 version 1709 (2017 "Fall Creators Update"). If your Hotkey contains the WINDOWS key and you are pasting to Windows 10 1709, you need to release the Hotkey before the paste will occur.
Added an Advanced button to the Options dialog, which will display another dialog with some more advanced options.
Added an advanced option to use a new experimental paste method. It is still in testing, but allows PureText to paste without needing to release the Hotkey first on Windows 10 version 1709 or later.
Added an advanced option to periodically reset the Hotkey detection. This is only for people who find that PureText stops responding to their Hotkey after some time. It is a rare issue that happens on very slow computers or in conjunction with other software that cause Hotkey issues.
What was new in version 5.0 (2017-02-27)

Fixed pasting issue with Chrome (version 50 and newer). If your Hotkey contains the WINDOWS key and you are pasting to Chrome, you need to release the Hotkey before the paste will occur.
Fixed issue where /S option wouldn't play sound.
Added Welcome dialog on first run to explain how to use PureText.
Added /L option to allow for localization of PureText to other languages. It will generate a PureText.loc file with instructions on how to use it.
Using a new signing certificate for PureText.exe.
What was new in version 4.0 (2015-11-15)

Pasting now happens when you press your Hotkey instead of releasing it. You can also press-and-hold your Hotkey to perform multiple pastes.
Added Hotkey information to PureText's option dialog, which provides details about known Hotkeys and possible conflicts when picking a specific Hotkey.
Fixed issue where PureText would sometimes stop working after pressing Win+L or Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
More Hotkey combinations are supported and a few problematic Hotkeys have been blocked.
PureText will now warn you if you are running PureText.exe from a temporary folder or if PureText.exe is marked as 'blocked'. These can happen when PureText.exe is ran directly from the zip file that is downloaded from the internet.
PureText.exe is now digitally signed with my publisher certificate, which makes Windows and some virus protection programs happier.
Fixed some pasting issues with Firefox and Thunderbird on Windows XP.
Added /N startup option to start with no icon.
Added /U startup option to uninstall registry entries.

Removed the ability to create Hotkeys that include the ALT key, as the ALT key prevents the Paste feature from working.
